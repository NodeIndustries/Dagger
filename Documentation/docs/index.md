# Dagger Project

## Concept Documentation

This documentation cannot currently be applied to Dagger. Dagger is currently not a
functioning language and this documentation is the blueprints for the actual language to be built off of.

**[You may contribute to these docs on GitHub](https://github.com/nbn64/Dagger)**

## Dagger as it stands

Dagger will remain in documentation form until enough of the documentation is built to begin development on the low level language. Here is the plan

1. Complete Low Level Documentation *(Hilt)*
2. Develop Low Level Language with Assembly or Machine Code *(or plain binary if we have skilled developers)*
3. Complete Language Documentation *(Blade)*
4. Develop the normal level language off of the low level language
	- Dagger is a package based language past is basic functions therefor this step will involve development for each feature of the language to be included in the default Dagger Blade package
5. Complete Documentation for Command Line software
6. Develop Command Line software off of Dagger
7. Complete Documentation for Web Language
