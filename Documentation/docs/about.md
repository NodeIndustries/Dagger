# Dagger Project

## Parts

### Languages

**Low Level Language:** Hilt

**Language:** Blade

**Web Framework:** Alloy

### Tools

**Kernel:** Carbon

**Operating System:** Gemstone

**Command Line:** Furnace

**Package Manager:** Sheath

**IDE:** Forge

## Versioning

*The version of Dagger is represented in it's logo*

*The official full version name is represented by Dagger's (the actual physical object) specs*

**Hilt** uses various woods, metals, and rocks *(EX: Titanium Hilt 1.0)*

**Blade** uses various metal types that are often the same as the hilt *(EX: Titanium Blade 1.0)*

**Alloy** uses alloys

**Sheath** uses leathers and fabrics

**Carbon** uses carbon bonds in order of atomic number *(EX: Carbon-Hydrogen 1.0)*

**Gemstone** uses various gemstones *(EX: Gemstone Lazulite 1.0)*

## Overall Concept

### Dagger is built off of itself

Dagger's parts are built as standalone languages that run off Hilt. Therefor Alloy can be run on a web server without Blade. This allows Dagger languages to be installed without having to modify files that many server owners are reluctant to touch.

### Dagger is built to make sense and make the developers happy
### Dagger has the features every language should have
### Dagger implements into any OS, architecture, kernel, and other language 
### Dagger is fast
### Dagger is compatible across versions
### Dagger has beautiful syntax
Dagger is aesthetically pleasing and makes your code look beautiful and readable.
### Dagger is the language to end all other languages
Of corse Dagger is not replacing the stuff that doesn't need replacing. In-page Javascript, HTML, and CSS for example, do not need to be replaced. Only improved. The goal is to take all the best concepts of all kinds of languages and put them together. To improve them, and to add brand new concepts to change they way developers program.  It is as easy as **ERSC**: Efficiency, reliability, scalability, and compatibility.
